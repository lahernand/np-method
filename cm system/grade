To grade:  
    write "GRADE STUDENTS" to the console.
    write "3. NodeJS" to the console.
    write "2. JavaScript" to the console.
    write "1. MongoDB" to the console.
    skip one line to the console.
    write "Select a course:" to the console.
    read a string from the console.        
    put the string into a course.
    write "Grade everyone [1], One student [2]:" to the console.
    read a string called option from the console.
    if the option is "1", grade the course.
    if the option is "2", grade one giving the course.

To grade a course:
  if the course is "1", put "D:\cal-4700 initiative\CMS\cm system\files\1.txt"  into a path.
  if the course is "2", put "D:\cal-4700 initiative\CMS\cm system\files\2.txt"  into the path.
  if the course is "3", put "D:\cal-4700 initiative\CMS\cm system\files\3.txt"  into the path.
  read the path into a buffer called original. If the i/o error is not blank, write the i/o error on the console.
  slap a rider on the original.
  get a string called header from the original given the rider.
  write "the header: " then the header to the console.
  append the header then the crlf string to a buffer.  
  Loop.    
    get a string from the original given the rider.    
    if the string is blank, break.    
    if the string is the crlf string, break.    
    get a token from the string. 
    write "Grade to: " then the token then " - " to the console without advancing.
    read another string from the console.
    append the token then " - " then the other string then the crlf string to the buffer.

    put "G" into an activity's action. put the system's date/time into the activity's date.  [log]
    put the token into the activity's control. put the course into the activity's course. 
    register the activity.
  Repeat.
  write the buffer to the path.
  If the i/o error is not blank, write the i/o error on the console.
  write "Grades registered" to the console.

To grade one giving a course:
  write "Enter control number:" to the console.
  read a string called control from the console.
  write "Enter grade:" to the console.
  read a string called gradestu from the console.
  if the course is "1", put "D:\cal-4700 initiative\CMS\cm system\files\1.txt"  into a path.
  if the course is "2", put "D:\cal-4700 initiative\CMS\cm system\files\2.txt"  into the path.
  if the course is "3", put "D:\cal-4700 initiative\CMS\cm system\files\3.txt"  into the path.
  read the path into a buffer called original. If the i/o error is not blank, write the i/o error on the console.
  slap a rider on the original.
  Loop.    
    get a string from the original given the rider.
    if the string is blank, break.    
    get a token from the string.
    if the token is the control,  append the control then " - " then the gradestu then the crlf string to a buffer.
    if the token is not the control, append the string then the crlf string to the buffer.  
    put "G" into an activity's action. put the system's date/time into the activity's date.  [log]
    put the control into the activity's control. put the course into the activity's course. 
    register the activity.
  Repeat.
  write the buffer to the path.
  If the i/o error is not blank, write the i/o error on the console.
  write "Grade registered".
